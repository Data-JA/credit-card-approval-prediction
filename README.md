## Dataset
Credit Card Approval dataset

## Source
UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to describe how machine learning aids in the process of approving credit card applications for a traditional bank. This technique is used to improve and automate the system. The power of machine learning erdicates the manual analysing of these applications, which are often human error-prone and time consuming.
